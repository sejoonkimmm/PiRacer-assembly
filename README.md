## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience in assembling and testing a PiRacer, a small, single-board computer-based racing car. The project will cover the basics of electronics, programming, and robotics, and will provide students with a foundation in these important areas of technology.

## Project Description

The PiRacer is a compact, single-board computer-based racing car that uses the Raspberry Pi computer as its brain. In this project, students will be working together in teams to assemble and test their PiRacers. The project will require students to use a variety of tools and technologies, including soldering irons, multimeters, and programming languages like Python.

## Project Goals and Objectives

- To gain hands-on experience in assembling and testing a PiRacer
- To develop basic skills in electronics, programming, and robotics
- To learn about the Raspberry Pi computer and its capabilities
- To work as part of a team to complete a complex project

## Project Assessment

The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Quality of the assembled PiRacer
- Completion of all project requirements
- Successful testing of the PiRacer
- Effective use of technology and programming languages
- Teamwork and collaboration skills
