# PiRacer-assembly

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience in assembling and testing a PiRacer, a small, single-board computer-based racing car. The project will cover the basics of electronics, programming, and robotics, and will provide students with a foundation in these important areas of technology.


## Project Description
The PiRacer is a compact, single-board computer-based racing car that uses the Raspberry Pi computer as its brain. In this project, students will be working together in teams to assemble and test their PiRacers. The project will require students to use a variety of tools and technologies, including soldering irons, multimeters, and programming languages like Python.


## Project Goals and Objectives
To gain hands-on experience in assembling and testing a PiRacer
To develop basic skills in electronics, programming, and robotics
To learn about the Raspberry Pi computer and its capabilities
To work as part of a team to complete a complex project

## Project Requirements
Raspberry Pi computer
Motors and wheels
Batteries and battery holder
Soldering iron and soldering wire
Multimeter
Python programming language
Any other necessary components, as specified in the kit guide

## Project Timeline
The project will be completed over the course of one week, with regular check-ins and progress reports to be submitted to the instructor. The following is a rough timeline of key dates:

Day 1: Introduction to the project and team formation

Day 2-3: Assembling and testing the PiRacer

Day 4-5: Programming and testing the PiRacer

Day 6: Final presentation and evaluation



## Project Assessment
The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Quality of the assembled PiRacer
Completion of all project requirements
Successful testing of the PiRacer
Effective use of technology and programming languages
Teamwork and collaboration skills

## Collaboration and Teamwork
Students will be working in teams of maximum four to complete this project. Each team member will be assigned specific tasks and responsibilities, and will be expected to contribute to the overall success of the project. Teams will be required to submit regular progress reports and to meet with the instructor for check-ins and feedback.


## Mentorship and Support
Students will be provided with mentorship and support from the instructor throughout the project. The instructor will be available for questions and guidance, and will hold regular check-ins and progress reports to provide feedback and support.


## Reflection and Self-Assessment
Students will be encouraged to reflect on their own learning and progress throughout the project. This will be done through self-assessment exercises and through feedback from the instructor and other team members.


## Submission
Turn in a github repository with following information:

A complete step by step guide of "How to assemble and setup PiRacer" with necessary information on all possible parts.

## Evaluation Form
Fill in this Evaluation Form DES-PiRacer-Assembly. You need to collect 2 feedbacks from 2 peers from other than your own team.
